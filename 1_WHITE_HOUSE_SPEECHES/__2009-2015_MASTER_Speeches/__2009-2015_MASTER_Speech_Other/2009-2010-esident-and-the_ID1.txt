 REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT  AT LUAU FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THEIR FAMILIES
  South Lawn

  7:05 P.M. EDT
  THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Welcome to the White House.  It's my great honor to introduce the folks behind me here.  But I just was telling the President on the way over, I like the state he represented -- but I love the state he's from.  (Laughter.)  Mr. President, I'm glad you brought Hawaii to the White House.
  Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.  (Applause.)
  THE PRESIDENT:  Aloha!
  AUDIENCE:  Aloha!
  THE PRESIDENT:  It is wonderful to see you all.  I am not going to make a long speech.  I just want to say to all the members of Congress, you've been working hard.  I wish I could give you all trips to Hawaii, but I figured since -- given our budget crunch we can't do that, that we'd at least bring Hawaii to you.  (Applause.)
  I want to thank our wonderful entertainer, Tihati, thank you very much.  (Applause.)  I want to thank all the chefs who prepared the outstanding food, especially Alan Wong, a friend from Hawaii, does a great job.  (Applause.)  I want to -- in case you don't know, this is Malia Obama -- (applause) -- Sasha Obama -- (applause) -- Michelle Obama -- (applause) -- and the star of the family, Bo Obama.  (Applause.)
  I hope you guys have a wonderful time.  Enjoy.  Feel free to just roam around here.  And thank you again, members of Congress, for the unbelievable work that you're doing for the American people each and every day, I appreciate you.  Thank you, guys.  (Applause.)
