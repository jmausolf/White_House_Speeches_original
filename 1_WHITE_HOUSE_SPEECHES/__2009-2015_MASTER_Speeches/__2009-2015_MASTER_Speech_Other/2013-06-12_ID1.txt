The President spoke to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today to discuss regional security and economic issues.  They pledged to continue to work together closely toward the elimination of North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  The leaders discussed the President’s recent meetings with President Xi Jinping of China, and agreed on the importance of ensuring stability and pursuing dialogue as it relates to the East China Sea.  The President stressed that the United States looks forward to being able to welcome Japan to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations as early as possible once current TPP members complete their domestic requirements.  Finally, the two leaders expressed the shared desire to work together closely at the up-coming G8 Summit in Northern Ireland.
