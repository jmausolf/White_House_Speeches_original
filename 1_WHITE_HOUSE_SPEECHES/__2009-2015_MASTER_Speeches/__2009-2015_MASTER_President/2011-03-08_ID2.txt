	     I just want to say how proud I am of all of you.  You guys are doing great in school.  I want to shake some hands.  I expect everybody here to keep working hard.  How many seniors here?  How many juniors?  Sophomores?  (Applause.)  All right.  Sophomores.  Freshmen.  Okay, well, the sophomores -- the juniors and the seniors, I know they’re working hard because they’re starting to apply to college.  Sophomores, you still got a lot of time, so you guys got to stay focused.  All right?  All right.  But I’m expecting everybody here to go to college, everybody here to succeed.  And I appreciate you guys very much.  I’m just going to shake as many hands as I can.
