  Office of the Press Secretary  _________________________________________________________________  For Immediate Release  February 6, 2009

 As Prepared for Delivery  


  Last month, another six hundred thousand Americans lost their jobs. That is the single worst month of job loss in 35 years. The Department of Labor also adjusted their job loss numbers for 2008 upwards, and now report that we have lost 3.6 million jobs since this recession began.

Good morning. I've just had the opportunity to welcome the members of my Economic Recovery Advisory Board. Iâ€™m grateful that I will have the counsel of these talented and experienced men and women in the challenging months to come.

And if there is anyone, anywhere, who doubts the need for wise counsel and bold and immediate action, consider the devastating news we just received this morning.
