 REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT  BEFORE MEETING ON BUILDING AMERICA'S FUTURE   Roosevelt Room   

2:25 P.M. EDT
  THE PRESIDENT:  Hey, guys.  Good to see you. 
  Well, I am thrilled to have three of the most innovative elected officials in the country representing not only a wide range of political spectrums, but also different states, different responsibilities, all of whom are concerned about the issue of our infrastructure and how we develop the long-term prosperity that's going to be so important for America's success.
  And I'm confident that with all these bright minds sitting around the table, that we're going to not only continue the progress that's been made in the Recovery Act, but we're going to be able to get a budget passed that reflects the concerns that we're hearing around the table and that we're going to be able to, on the Highway Reauthorization Act, we're also going to be able to build in some innovative approaches that will make a lot of difference and spur the kind of job creation, economic growth and development that we all want to see.
  All right.  Thank you, guys.
