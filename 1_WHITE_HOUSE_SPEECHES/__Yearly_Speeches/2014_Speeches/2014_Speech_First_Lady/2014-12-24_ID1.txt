MRS. OBAMA:  Hi!  This is Mrs. Obama, who am I talking to?

DANIEL:  Daniel.

MRS. OBAMA:  Is this Daniel?

DANIEL:  Mm-hmm.

MRS. OBAMA:  Do you have a sister with you, too?

DANIEL:  Mm-hmm.

MRS. OBAMA:  What's her name?

DANIEL:  Danielle.

MRS. OBAMA:  Daniel and Danielle, how old are you guys?

DANIEL:  I'm eight, Danielle is five.

MRS. OBAMA:  Are you excited tonight because it's Christmas Eve?

DANIEL:  Mm-hmm.

MRS. OBAMA:  This is one of the most exciting nights of the whole year, isn't it?

DANIEL:  Mm-hmm.

MRS. OBAMA:  Yes, my kids are excited, too.  Did you call to see where Santa is right now?

DANIEL:  Yes.

MRS. OBAMA:  Okay, I'm looking at the satellite right now and it says -- I see a bleep on the screen and it looks like it's Santa with a sleigh.  Yes, I think that's him and it says he is heading for Italy.  He is going to be in Italy in one minute and forty-eight seconds.  So he is moving pretty fast and he should probably get to your house right when you go to sleep tonight.  So you and Danielle have to get to bed on time, when your mom -- your folks tell you to go to bed and shut your eyes.  And the minute you guys are sound asleep, Santa is going to be at your house, okay?

DANIEL:  Mm-hmm.  Thank you.

MRS. OBAMA:  So you guys have a very merry Christmas, okay?  I think you've been good boys and girls, right?

DANIEL:  Mm-hmm.

MRS. OBAMA:  So it's going to be an exciting morning, okay?

DANIEL:  Okay.  Thank you and merry Christmas.

MRS. OBAMA:  Okay, bye-bye, sweetie.  Merry Christmas.

DANIEL:  Bye.

MRS. OBAMA:  Bye.

EMMA:  Hello!

MRS. OBAMA:  Hi!  Who is this?  This is Michelle Obama, the First Lady, who am I talking to?

EMMA:  Emma Rusk, and my sister, Sara Rusk.

MRS. OBAMA:  Emma and Sara.  Wow, are you guys in Ontario?

EMMA:  Yes.

MRS. OBAMA:  How old are you both?

EMMA:  I am ten and my sister is eight.

MRS. OBAMA:  Ten and eight, oh you guys must be so excited tonight that it's Christmas Eve, aren't you?

EMMA:  Yes.

MRS. OBAMA:  Yes, so are we.  We're in Hawaii and my kids are really excited that it's Christmas Eve.  So are you calling because you want to find out where Santa is?

EMMA:  Yes.

MRS. OBAMA:  Okay, well, I'm looking at the satellite.  They asked me to man the satellite for a little bit, and I'm looking at the tracker.  Wow, he is all the way in Italy -- can you believe that?  Sardinia, Italy.  He is flying really fast.  I mean, you wouldn't believe how fast Santa flies.  But I can see that he has got his reindeer.  And it looks -- I'm getting a close-up -- and it looks like he has got a lot of presents in that sleigh.  So have you guys been good girls this year?

EMMA:  Yes.

MRS. OBAMA:  What do you want for Christmas?  What's the one thing you really hope you get tomorrow?

EMMA:  Well, I'd really like a little music player to go on field trips and everything like that.  My friend Mackenzie, she has this DS that she always brings and she never shares it.

MRS. OBAMA:  Yeah?  That sounds pretty good.  Well, here is the thing, Santa won't get to your house until you guys are fast asleep.  You know that, right?

EMMA:  Yes.

MRS. OBAMA:  He kind of bops all over the world, but he gets to your house when you're fast asleep.  So you guys have to go to bed when your folks tell you to go to bed.  And go right to sleep, and then he'll come.  All right?

EMMA:  Yes.

MRS. OBAMA:  Okay, well, you guys get a good night's sleep, okay?

EMMA:  Thank you for speaking to me.

MRS. OBAMA:  Oh, thank you for calling, Sweetie.

EMMA:  And my sister would really like to talk to you.

MRS. OBAMA:  Okay.  Hello?

SARA:  Hi.

MRS. OBAMA:  Hi, is this Sarah?  Hi, Sarah!

SARA:  Do you believe in Santa?

MRS. OBAMA:  I do believe in Santa.  I believe in Santa -- Christmas Eve is the best night in the whole year, don't you think?

SARA:  Yes.

MRS. OBAMA:  That's why I try to be good all year.  I try to help other people and eat my vegetables, and be kind to all the kids that I know because I believe that Santa is watching, don't you?

SARA:  Does the President believe in Santa?

MRS. OBAMA:  The President believes in Santa very much, yes.  That's one of the reasons why we try to help the kids who call, because we've got all this wonderful equipment.  So we like to get on the phone and help kids see where Santa is.  And I just told your sister he is in Italy right now.  Can you believe that?  All the way in another part of the world, Santa and his reindeer are flying right now.  And they're going to be at your house as soon as you're fast asleep.  That's when Santa comes.  He doesn't come until you're asleep, okay?

SARA:  Okay.

MRS. OBAMA:  All right.  So be good tonight, listen to your folks, and have a very merry Christmas tomorrow.  Okay, sweetie?

SARA:  Okay.

MRS. OBAMA:  All right, bye-bye.  Goodnight!

SARA:  Merry Christmas.

EMMA:  Merry Christmas!

MRS. OBAMA:  Thank you, sweetie.

SARA:  Bye.

SAMANTHA:  Yes.

MRS. OBAMA:  Yes, so are we.  I'm here at this place called NORAD that can look at any place in the world, and I'm helping them track Santa.  So I'm using their computers, because they've got a big computer system that helps track Santa.  And do you want to know where he is right now?

SAMANTHA:  Yes.

MRS. OBAMA:  Right now, he is in a country called Croatia, which is in Europe.

SAMANTHA:  Oh.

MRS. OBAMA:  Yes, and he is traveling so fast.  And I can see, because you can zoom in, I can see that he has got his reindeer and his sleigh, and it's full of toys.  It's full of toys for all the good girls and boys.  Have you been good this year?

SAMANTHA:  Yes.

MRS. OBAMA:  Yes?  Have the rest of your -- you have other sisters, right?

SAMANTHA:  Santa is going to give us presents?

MRS. OBAMA:  He is going to bring some presents.  But, look, Santa doesn't get to your house until ever child in the house is fast asleep.  You do know that, right?

SAMANTHA:  Yes.

MRS. OBAMA:  He doesn't come until you go to sleep so you've got to kind of get all the excitement out, and you've got to go bed when your mom tells you to tonight, okay?

SAMANTHA:  Okay.  Tonight we're going to church.

MRS. OBAMA:  Are you going to -- well, he is going to come when you get home from church.

SAMANTHA:  Ohhh --

MRS. OBAMA:  Yes, so it's great that you guys are going to church.  Are you going to say some prayers for other people around the world?

SAMANTHA:  Yes.

MRS. OBAMA:  That's wonderful.  I'm very proud of you guys.  It sounds like you've had a great year this year.  You've been pretty good, huh?

SAMANTHA:  Yes.

MRS. OBAMA:  All right, well, then Santa knows.  So he is going to be showing up.

SAMANTHA:  Okay.

MRS. OBAMA:  Okay, you guys have a very merry Christmas, okay?  Tell your whole family that we wish them -- the President and the First Lady -- we wish you guys a very merry Christmas, okay?

SAMANTHA:  Okay.

CAMERON:  Yup!

MRS. OBAMA:  All right, I'm looking at my satellite.  Cameron, do you know where Santa is right this minute?

CAMERON:  Where?

MRS. OBAMA:  He is in Kosovo?  He is all the way in Europe right now with his sleigh, and he has got nine reindeer.  It looks like -- I'm counting, and I think I count nine, but I might be missing one.  And he is flying really fast.  It takes these special computers to track him down.  So he is in Kosovo.  But do you know when he gets to your house?

CAMERON:  When?

MRS. OBAMA:  As soon as you are fast asleep, okay, Cameron?

CAMERON:  Okay.

MRS. OBAMA:  I'm looking at the satellite, and right now, he is flying over Hungary.  Can you believe that?  That's a country in Europe.

AUBREY:  Wow!

MRS. OBAMA:  Yes, he flies so fast.  He can travel anywhere in the world in the blink of an eye.  And you know when he comes to your house?

AUBREY:  No.

MRS. OBAMA:  When you're fast asleep.  That's when he knows to come, to bring the toys to your house.  So you've got to go to bed when your mom and your folks tell you to go to bed, okay?

AUBREY:  I don't need to go to bed.  (Laughter.)

MRS. OBAMA:  You don't think you need to go to bed?  (Laughter.)

AUBREY:  No, we don't!

MRS. OBAMA:  You're going to stay up, you think?

AUBREY:  But I'm not tired!

MRS. OBAMA:  Well, that may be later.  You may not be tired right now, but maybe later.  And it only takes a second.  You close your eyes for a second and Santa is there.  There have been times when I was little, I tried to stay up, too, but I just never could make it.  But maybe, maybe when you close your eyes for that second, when you get tired, that's when Santa is going to show up, okay?

AUBREY:  Ahhh!

MRS. OBAMA:  Okay.  (Laughter.)  Have you guys been good this year?

MRS. OBAMA:  Hi, this is Michelle Obama.  I'm helping out at NORAD to help kids who want to find out where Santa is.  I hear that we've got some kids over there who want to find out.  Are they on the line?

FATHER:  They are!

MRS. OBAMA:  Wow, who am I talking to?

PAIGE:  Paige.

MRS. OBAMA:  Hi, Paige!  This is Michelle Obama, how are you?

PAIGE:  I'm great.

MRS. OBAMA:  Is Westley there, too?  And Ila?

FATHER:  Elly.

MRS. OBAMA:  Terrific.  Do you guys want to know where Santa is right now?

FATHER:  Yes, we're just trying to find out when these kids need to go to bed.

MRS. OBAMA:  Yes, well, right now, I'm looking at the satellite and it shows -- I see a sleigh and I see reindeer.  But you know, Santa, right now, he is in Poland.

FATHER:  Poland?

MRS. OBAMA:  He is in Krakow, Poland right now.  But here is the thing that I have learned about Santa, is that he travels at the speed of light.  And he can be anywhere at a moment's notice.  And right now, he happens to be in Europe.  But you can let Paige and let all the kids know that the minute they go to bed, that's when Santa shows up.  So he is not going to get there until they go to sleep.

FATHER:  Okay, did you guys here that?

CHILDREN:  Mm-hmm.

FATHER:  Wow, tell the President hi from the Stevensons(ph).  (Laughter.)

MRS. OBAMA:  We will tell the President.  And I hope that all the kids over there go to bed as soon as their parents tell them to go to bed.

FATHER:  They will.

MRS. OBAMA:  Okay.  Well, I hope you guys have been good.

FATHER:  They've been fantastic.

MRS. OBAMA:  That's awesome.  Well, that means you're going to have a great Christmas, and you guys have a really safe and wonderful new year.

FATHER:  Thank you.  Merry Christmas!

MRS. OBAMA:  Hello, this is Michelle Obama.  I hear that I've got Cole and Jackson on the phone and they're looking for Santa.

MOTHER:  Yes!  Say hi.

COLE:  Hi, Mrs. Obama.

MRS. OBAMA:  Hi!  How are you guys doing?

COLE:  We're doing good.

MRS. OBAMA:  Yes, are you excited it's Christmas Eve?  It's the most exciting night of the whole year, isn't it?

COLE:  Yes.

MRS. OBAMA:  Yes, well, I am so excited.  That's why I like to help out NORAD and help kids find Santa.  Because when my kids were little, they wanted to know every second what was going on.  So I'm looking at the satellite right now, and it says that Santa and his sleigh, in six seconds, will be flying over Prague.  Do you know where Prague is?  It's in Europe.  It's in the Czech Republic.  But here is the thing about Santa:  Even though he is all the way in Europe, he can travel at the speed of light, which means he can be anywhere in a matter of seconds.  So he comes to your house as soon as you're fast asleep.  Did you know that?

COLE:  Wow.

MRS. OBAMA:  Yes, so you've got to go to bed when your mom and dad, they tell you to go to bed, okay?

COLE:  Okay.

MRS. OBAMA:  And that's when Santa will show up.  All right?  You got it?

COLE:  Yes.  How is the President?

MRS. OBAMA:  The President is good.  He is having a meeting right now with a Prime Minister somewhere.  But he is here in Hawaii.  We're here with our family, and everyone is excited for Christmas tomorrow.  So I will tell him that you asked how he is doing.  I know that he wishes you and your family a very merry Christmas.

COLE:  Merry Christmas!

MRS. OBAMA:  All right, you guys have a great day tomorrow.

FAMILY:  Merry Christmas!

MRS. OBAMA:  All right, merry Christmas.  Happy new year.

CAROLINE:  Yes, I'm so excited.  I can't wait to see what Santa brings.

MRS. OBAMA:  Oh, my goodness.  Well, I am helping out at NORAD and I like to do this every year because I get to help spot where Santa is.  Do you want to know where he is right now?

CAROLINE:  Yeah!

MRS. OBAMA:  He is, right now, flying over Poland -- Warsaw, Poland.  All the way in Europe.  Can you imagine that?

CAROLINE:  I can.  Wow, that's far away.  When will he come?

MRS. OBAMA:  He is going to be at your house as soon as you're fast asleep.  That's how he works.  He can be anywhere in the world at the speed of light.  But he doesn't come to your house until you're asleep.  So tonight is the night where you've got to settle your excitement and go to bed when your parents tell you to go to bed.  Okay?

CAROLINE:  Okay, will do.  Will you tell Mr. Obama I said merry Christmas?

MRS. OBAMA:  I sure will, sweetie.  And you tell your family that we wish you guys all a really merry Christmas and a happy new year, okay?

AUSTIN:  No.  (Laughter.)

MRS. OBAMA:  Not yet?  Well, I know you're going to have a wonderful Christmas, okay?

AUSTIN:  Okay.

MRS. OBAMA:  It will be here before you know it.  I know it's so exciting and it's hard to settle down but eventually you'll get tired and that's when Santa will know, and he is going to pop in and drop off the toys because I hear you've been a pretty good boy this year, right?

AUSTIN:  Yes, ma'am.

MRS. OBAMA:  All right, well, you have a great Christmas, okay, and we wish your whole family a very merry Christmas and a happy new year.

AUSTIN:  Say hello to Mr. President for me.

MRS. OBAMA:  He is flying over Berlin in Germany, all the way in Europe.  That's all the way across the ocean.  Right now, that's where he is.  And there's a little blip on the screen that shows me where he is.

CASSIDY:  That's so cool.

CASSIDY:  Yes.

MRS. OBAMA:  Yes, right now, he can travel so fast that he can be anywhere in the world at a moment's notice.  So even though he is in Germany, right now, when you shut your eyes and you're really sound asleep, that's when he knows it's time to come to your house.  So that's what you've got to do tonight.  You've got to settle down and go to bed when your parents tell you to go to bed.  And shut your eyes, and dream of really good things, okay?

CASSIDY:  Okay.

MRS. OBAMA:  All right, you're going to have a great Christmas tomorrow, okay?

CASSIDY:  Okay, you, too.

MRS. OBAMA:  All right, and wish your whole family a merry Christmas from me, okay?

CASSIDY:  All right.

MRS. OBAMA:  All right, thanks for calling, sweetie.  Have fun tomorrow.

CASSIDY:  You, too.  Bye.

MRS. OBAMA:  Bye-bye.
