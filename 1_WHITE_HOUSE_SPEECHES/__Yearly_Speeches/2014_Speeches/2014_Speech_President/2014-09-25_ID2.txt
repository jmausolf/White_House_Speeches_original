For Immediate Release          

Remarks by President Obama Before Bilateral Meeting with President el-SiSi of Egypt

The White House

Office of the Press Secretary

United Nations Building
	New York City, New York

12:30 P.M. EDT

PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, I want to welcome President el-SiSi to New York and to the United States.  And I’m very much looking forward to this opportunity to share ideas. Obviously, the U.S.-Egyptian relationship has been an important cornerstone of our security policy and our policy in the Middle East for a very long time.  This is our first opportunity face-to-face to discuss a wide range of issues -- everything from the Palestinian-Israeli situation in Gaza, to Libya, to the issues of ISIL, Iraq and Syria. 

And so I want to welcome the President here and his delegation, and I look forward to a constructive, productive conversation.

Thank you, everybody.
