	REMARKS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA AT THE NEW YORK CITY SEPTEMBER 11TH 10TH ANNIVERSARY COMMEMORATION CEREMONY


	National September 11th Memorial
	New York City, New York


	8:47 A.M. EDT


	THE PRESIDENT:


	God is our refuge and strength,
	a very present help in trouble.
	Therefore, we will not fear,
	even though the earth be removed,
	and though the mountains be carried
	into the midst of the sea.
	Though its waters roar and be troubled,
	though the mountains shake
	with its swelling,
	thereâ€™s a river
	whose streams shall make glad
	the City of God,
	the holy place of the Tabernacle
	of the Most High.
	God is in the midst of her.
	She shall not be moved.
	God shall help her
	just at the break of dawn.
	The nations raged,
	the kingdoms were moved.
	He uttered his voice.
	The earth melted.
	The Lord of Hosts is with us.
	The God of Jacob is our refuge.
	Come behold the works of the Lord
	who has made desolations in the Earth.
	He makes wars cease
	to the ends of the Earth.
	He breaks the bough
	and cuts the spear in two.
	He burns the chariot in fire.
	Be still and know that I am God.
	I will be exalted among the nations.
	I will be exalted in the Earths.
	The Lord of Hosts is with us.
	The God of Jacob is our refuge.
