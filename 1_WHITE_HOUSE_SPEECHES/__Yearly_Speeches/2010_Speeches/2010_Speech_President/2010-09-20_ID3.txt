THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, Philadelphia!  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Thank you, everybody.  It is good to be back in Philly.  (Applause.)  First of all, I noticed everybody is in a better mood after the game yesterday.  (Laughter.)  The Bears did well, too, I just want to point out -- (laughter) -- 2-0.  But congratulations on the Eagles.  You guys got a win.  (Laughter.) 


It’s also good to be back in Philly because I had to stop by the Reading Terminal Market.  (Laughter and applause.)  Got a couple of cheese steaks -- (laughter) -- that are waiting for me back there, so -- (laughter) -- but I didn’t want to keep you all waiting.  I also bought some apples so that Michelle would feel like I was eating healthy.  (Laughter.)
