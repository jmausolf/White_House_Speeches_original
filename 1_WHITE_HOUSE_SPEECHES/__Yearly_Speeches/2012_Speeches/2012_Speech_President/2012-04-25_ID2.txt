	Iowa City, Iowa

	THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody!  (Applause.)  It is great to be back in Iowa City.  (Applause.)  I'm not going to give a long speech here.  I just want to say thank you to all the people who are taking an interest in this important issue.  I know we've got a lot of students here.  Everybody cares about making sure you guys can pay for college in an affordable way, so that's what I'm going to be talking about.


	But I just want to tell all of you I couldn't appreciate you more, taking the time to come out, and I hope that -- how many seniors do we have here?  (Applause.)  All right.  Seniors, you've got just a few more weeks to go, so make sure to finish strong; don't goof off too much.  (Laughter.)


	And I just want you to know that Iowa always feels like home to me, because I spend so much time here.  (Applause.)  So, all right, thank you, everybody.  I'm going to shake some hands.  Thanks, everybody.  (Applause.)
