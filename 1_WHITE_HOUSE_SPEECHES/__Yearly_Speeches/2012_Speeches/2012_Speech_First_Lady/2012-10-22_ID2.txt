MRS. OBAMA:  Oh, you guys!  (Applause.)  Thank you so much!  I'm not going to talk long because I'm going to talk inside, but I wanted to thank you guys.  You make us feel so good and so focused.  We appreciate all that you all are doing for us -- all the prayers, all the hard work.  (Applause.) 

We've got 15 more days.  (Applause.)  So we need you guys to be focused, because every vote is going to count.  (Applause.)  And you all sound pretty fired up, so that’s all we need to hear.
	 

So I'm going to go in.  Hopefully, you all will see me; I'll wave to you all in the overflow.  Just know that we love you, and you have a President who is fighting for you every single day.  (Applause.) 

Thanks so much.  (Applause.)
