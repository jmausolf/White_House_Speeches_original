MRS. OBAMA:  Oh, my gosh!  You guys be careful!  (Applause.)  Oh, wow!  It sounds like you all are having some good fun out here!  (Applause.) 

You know, I am happy to be here.  We are celebrating the second anniversary of "Let's Move."  I have been traveling all over the country -- I've been to Iowa, watching how kids are eating well and changing their schools.  I've been to Dallas, with "Top Chef."  (Applause.)  And we've made -- Dallas!  (Applause.)  I had some good dinner here in Florida.  And now I'm hanging out with all of you. 

And I just want to thank Disney and all that they have done to support "Let's Move" and to make sure that our kids are eating right and being active.  Right?  We want to give Disney a big round of applause.  (Applause.) 

So now I hear you all have been practicing something for me.  You've got a little dance you want to show me? 

AUDIENCE:  Yes!

MRS. OBAMA:  You guys know I like to dance.  I haven't completely gotten the dance down, but I'm going to watch you all -- right?  All right, you all ready to do some dancing?

AUDIENCE;  Yes!

MRS. OBAMA:  Let's do it!
